A snapshot is only taken when a specified selector is detected visible in the output html. This tool is useful when your site is largely ajax content, or an SPA, and you want your dynamic content indexed by search engines.\n\nhtml-snapshots gets urls to process from either a robots.txt or sitemap.xml. Alternatively, you can supply an array with completely arbitrary urls, or a line delimited textfile with arbitrary host-relative paths.\n\nhtml-snapshots processes all the urls in parallel in their own PhantomJS processes.\n\n## Feedback\nPlease [let me know how you are using this library](http://www.localnerve.com/blog/how-are-you-using-html-snapshots/) so I can make sure it evolves appropriately.\n\n## Getting Started\nThis library requires PhantomJS '>=1.7.1'\n\n### Installation\nThe simplest way to install html-snapshots is to use [npm](http://npmjs.org), just `npm\ninstall html-snapshots` will download html-snapshots and all dependencies.\n\n### Grunt Task\nIf you are interested in the grunt task that uses this library, check out [grunt-html-snapshots](http://github.com/localnerve/grunt-html-snapshots).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Simple example\n```javascript\nvar htmlSnapshots = require('html-snapshots');\nhtmlSnapshots.run({\n  source: \"path/to/robots.txt\",\n  hostname: \"exampledomain.com\",\n  outputDir: \"./snapshots\",\n  outputDirClean: true,\n  selector: \"#dynamic-content\"\n});\n```\nThis reads the urls from your robots.txt and produces snapshots in the ./snapshots directory. In this example, a selector named \"#dynamic-content\" appears in all pages across the site. Once this selector is visible in a page, the html snapshot is taken.\n\n### Example - Per page selectors and timeouts\n```javascript\nvar htmlSnapshots = require('html-snapshots');\nhtmlSnapshots.run({\n  input: \"sitemap\",\n  source: \"path/to/sitemap.xml\",\n  outputDir: \"./snapshots\",\n  outputDirClean: true,\n  selector: { \"http://mysite.com\": \"#home-content\", \"__default\": \"#dynamic-content\" },\n  timeout: { \"http://mysite.com/superslowpage\", 6000, \"__default\": 5000 }\n});\n```\nThis reads the urls from your sitemap.xml and produces snapshots in the ./snapshots directory. In this example, a selector named \"#dynamic-content\" appears in all pages across the site except the home page, where \"#home-content\" appears (the appearance of a selector in the output indicates that the page is ready for a snapshot). Also, html-snapshots uses the default timeout (5000 ms) on all pages except http://mysite.com/superslowpage, where it waits 6000 ms.\n\n### Example - Per page special output paths\n```javascript\nvar htmlSnapshots = require('html-snapshots');\nhtmlSnapshots.run({\n  input: \"sitemap\",\n  source: \"path/to/sitemap.xml\",\n  outputDir: \"./snapshots\",\n  outputDirClean: true,\n  outputPath: { \"http://mysite.com/services/?page=1\": \"services/page/1\", \"http://mysite.com/services/?page=2\": \"services/page/2\" },\n  selector: \"#dynamic-content\"\n});\n```\nThis example implies there are a couple of pages with query strings in sitemap.xml, and we don't want html-snapshots to create directories with query string characters in the names. We would also have to have a rewrite rule that reflects this same mapping when `_escaped_fragment_` shows up in the querystring of a request so we serve the snapshot from the appropriate directory.\n\n### Example - Array\n```javascript\nvar htmlSnapshots = require('html-snapshots');\nhtmlSnapshots.run({\n  input: \"array\",\n  source: [\"http://mysite.com\", \"http://mysite.com/contact\", \"http://mysite.com:82/special\"],\n  outputDir: \"./snapshots\",\n  outputDirClean: true,  \n  selector: \"#dynamic-content\"\n});\n```\nGenerates snapshots for \"/\", \"/contact\", and \"/special\" from mysite.com. \"/special\" uses port 82. All use http protocol.\n\n### Example - Completion callback, Remote robots.txt\n```javascript\nvar htmlSnapshots = require('html-snapshots');\nhtmlSnapshots.run({\n  input: \"robots\",      // default, so not required\n  source: \"http://localhost/robots.txt\",\n  hostname: \"localhost\",\n  outputDir: \"./snapshots\",\n  outputDirClean: true,  \n  selector: \"#dynamic-content\"\n}, function(nonError) { \n  /* \n     do something when html-snapshots has completed. \n     nonError is undefined if all snapshots were generated successfully, \n     otherwise it is false. \n     This makes it compatible with mocha and grunt \"done\".\n  */ \n});\n```\nGenerates snapshots in the ./snapshots directory for paths found in http://localhost/robots.txt. Uses those paths against \"localhost\" to get the actual html output. Expects \"#dynamic-content\" to appear in all output. The callback function is called when snapshots concludes.\n\n## Options\nApart from the default settings, there are a number of options that can be specified. Options are specified in an object to the module's run method ``htmlSnapshots.run({ optionName: value })``.\n\n+ `input` \n  + default: `\"robots\"`\n  + Specifies the input generator to be used to produce the urls. \n      \n      Possible *values*:\n      \n      `\"sitemap\"` Supply urls from a local or remote sitemap.xml file.      \n      `\"robots\"` Supply urls from a local or remote robots.txt file. Robots.txt files with wildcards are NOT supported - Use \"sitemap\" instead.      \n      `\"textfile\"` Supply urls from a local line-oriented text file in the style of robots.txt      \n      `\"array\"`, supply arbitrary urls from a javascript array.\n\n+ `source`\n  + default: `\"./robots.txt\"`, `\"./sitemap.xml\"`, `\"./line.txt\"`, or `[]`, depending on the input generator.\n  + Specifies the input source. This must be a valid location of a robots.txt, sitemap.xml, or a textfile or the associated input generators. robots.txt and sitemap.xml can be local or remote. However, for the array input generator, this must be a javascript array of urls.\n+ `hostname`\n  + default: `\"localhost\"`\n  + Specifies the hostname to use for paths found in a robots.txt or textfile. Applies to all pages. This option is ignored if you are using the sitemap or array input generators.\n+ `port`\n  + default: 80\n  + Specifies the port to use for all paths found in a robots.txt or textfile. This option is ignored if you are using the sitemap or array input generators.\n+ `auth`\n  + default: none\n  + Specifies the old-school authentication portion of the url. Applies to all path found in a robots.txt or textfile.\n+ `protocol`\n  + default: `\"http\"`\n  + Specifies the protocol to use for all paths found in a robots.txt or textfile. This option is ignored if you are using the sitemap or array input generators.\n+ `outputDir`\n  + default: `\"./snapshots\"`\n  + Specifies the root output directory to put all the snapshot files in. Paths to the snapshot files in the output directory are defined by the paths in the urls themselves. The snapshot files are always named \"index.html\".\n+ `outputDirClean`\n  + default: `false`\n  + Specifies if html-snapshots should clean the output directory before it creates the snapshots.\n+ `outputPath`\n  + default: none\n  + Specifies per url overrides to the generated snapshot output path. The default output path for a snapshot file is rooted at outputDir, but is simply an echo of the input path - plus any arguments. Depending on your urls, your `_escaped_fragment_` rewrite rule (see below), or the characters allowed in directory names in your environment, it might be necessary to use this option to change the output paths.\n\n      The value can be one of these *javascript types*:\n\n      `\"object\"` If the value is an object, it must be a key/value pair object where the key must match the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found by the input generator.\n      `\"function\"` If the value is a function, it is called for every page and passed a single argument that is the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found in the input.\n\n  Notes: For pretty urls, this option may not be wanted/needed. The output file name is always \"index.html\".\n\n+ `selector`\n  + default: `\"body\"`\n  + Specifies the selector to find in the output before taking the snapshot. The appearence of this selector defines a page's readiness for a snapshot. \n      \n      The value can be one of these *javascript types*:\n      \n      `\"string\"` If the value is a string, it is used for every page.       \n      `\"object\"` If the value is an object, it is interpreted as key/value pairs where the key must match the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found by the input generator. This allows you to specify selectors for individual pages. The reserved key \"__default\" allows you to specify the default selector so you don't have to specify a selector every individual page.\n      \n      `\"function\"` If the value is a function, it is called for every page and passed a single argument that is the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found in the input.\n\n+ `timeout`\n  + default: 5000 (milliseconds)\n  + Specifies the time to wait for the selector to become visible.\n      \n      The value can be of these one of these *javascript types*:\n      \n      `\"number\"` If the value is a number, it is used for every page in the website.      \n      `\"object\"` If the value is an object, it is interpreted as key/value pairs where the key must match the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found by the input generator. This allows you to specify timeouts for individual pages. The reserved key \"__default\" allows you to specify the default timeout so you don't have to specify a timeout for every individual page.\n      \n      `\"function\"` If the value is a function, it is called for every page and passed a single argument that is the url (or path in the case of robots.txt style) found in the input.\n\n+ `checkInterval`\n  + default: 250 (milliseconds)\n  + Specifies the rate at which the PhantomJS script checks to see if the selector is visible yet. Applies to all pages.\n+ `pollInterval`\n  + default: 500 (milliseconds)\n  + Specifies the rate at which html-snapshots checks to see if a PhantomJS script has completed. Applies to all pages.\n+ `snapshotScript`\n  + default: this library's phantom/snapshotSingle.js file\n  + Specifies the PhantomJS script to run to actually produce the snapshot. Override this if you need to supply your own snapshot script. This script is run per url (or path) by html-snapshots in a separate PhantomJS process. Applies to all pages.\n+ `phantomjs`\n  + default: A package local reference to phantomjs.\n  + Specifies the phantomjs executable to run. Override this if you want to supply a path to a different version of phantomjs. To reference PhantomJS globally in your environment, just use \"phantomjs\".\nSee [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) for more information.\n\n## Example Rewrite Rule\nHere is an example apache rewrite rule for rewriting \\_escaped\\_fragment\\_ requests to the snapshots directory on your server.\n```\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\n  RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^_escaped_fragment_=(.*)$\n  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/snapshots [NC]\n  RewriteRule ^(.*)/?$ /snapshots/$1 [L]\n</ifModule>\n```\nThis serves the snapshot to any request for a url (perhaps found by a bot in your robots.txt or sitemap.xml) to the snapshot output directory. In this example, no translation is done, it simply takes the request as is and serves its corresponding snapshot. So a request for `http://mysite.com/?_escaped_fragment_=` serves the mysite.com homepage snapshot.\n",
