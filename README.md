> (WIP) An example single page application that demonstrates using wordpress as an api

## Development Notes

### New Work:
+ Demonstrates foundation 4
+ Demonstrates Marionette
+ Demonstrates WP structures that play well with an SPA architecture

### External Dependencies
#### css and responsive fwk
+ Ruby
+ Compass
+ Sass

#### build and packages
+ Git
+ Node
+ Npm
+ Grunt-cli
+ Bower (manages runtime requirejs, webshim)

### Unmanaged Vendor packages

### Dynamically loaded modules
#### Dynamic and Conditionally loaded modules
+ webshim

#### TODO: version control dynamically loaded modules
How to version control these with names that are referenced by the require loader?
(I'm trying to avoid manual intervention in app/config.js)
Perhaps use grunt-regex-replace
